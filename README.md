# Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio. It uses a simple Webpack configuration, Pug, CSS Grid, and little else.

The live version can be found [here](http://alexandermorse.surge.sh/).

## Installing

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Building

```
npm run build:prod
```

This will create a folder named 'build' in the root directory.
